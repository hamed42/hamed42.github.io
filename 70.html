    <h2>Germany deported Christian to Iran, where she faces death</h2>
    <img src="images/Fateme Azad copy.jpg">
     <p id="content"></p>

<p>
  Fatima Azad, who sought asylum in Germany and was baptized, was deported back to Tehran, where she is now awaiting trial under “Sharia law.” She has no contact with her relatives who remained in Germany and is very alarmed about this, German ‘Bild’ reports about the fate of the Christian woman.<p>

<p>  In November 2015, Fatima divorced with her husband and, despite his protests, took three sons and flew to Germany. There she accepted Christianity with her children and applied to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) for asylum. However, her petition, like the petition of one of her sons, was rejected (the other two received a temporary residence permit).</p>

<p>The testimony of baptism and the positive response of the priest of the community, which Fatima Asad joined with the children, seemed to the court not weighty enough to provide her asylum in Germany. According to the judges, the woman “could not convincingly prove” that she is Christian – what other proof of this is required by the judges is unclear. Attorney Asad’s appeal challenging the judgment was also dismissed. And this is despite the fact that, according to German law, a person who is in danger of torture or execution has the right to asylum in Germany.</p>

<p>According to statistics regularly collected by international Christian organizations, Iran remains one of the most unfavorable countries in the world for Christians. Confession of faith in Christ in Iran is strictly limited. For conversion to Christianity, a person faces a prison term of more than ten years, and for the subsequent refusal to return to Islam, the death penalty.
