    <h2>For over two years wrongfully prosecuted: Arash Dosthossein's statement on his acquittal</h2>
    <img src="images/arash.jpg">
     <p id="content">On November 22, 2016, a big demonstration against the racist integration law took place in Munich, where I was arrested. I was accused of detonating pyrotechnics on the demo. The same day I was released with the help of my lawyer and a few weeks later I received a letter from the Munich District Court, in which this allegation was withdrawn.</p>

<p>A few months later, in early 2017, I was arrested and charged with beating a police officer with a flag at the same demonstration. On August 9, 2018, my first trial took place. After the police officer testified, the prosecutor presented the judge with a three-minute film that was cut from all the films of the demonstration day and demanded half a year in prison.</p>

<p>It was clear from the start that this three-minute movie was nothing more than a targeted scenario against me, showing that there was Arash at every turn, Arash hit and Arash left. In the process, there were often conflicting statements from police officers, such as: He had radioed his coworkers at this demonstration that Arash Dosthossien had beaten him and they should arrest him, etc. In this process, I had no lawyer and therefore did I ask the policeman himself how he knew my name right then? He replied, "No, I did not call the defendant on the radio, but described his characteristics to my colleagues."</p>

<p>Then I defended myself with the statement: "Apart from the intentional composition of the film, it is completely clear to anyone who can discern a bit of the mathematical and physical rules and circumstances that I am given the perspective of the camera and the distance between me and the actual conflict environment and the size of the real people in the real world, could not beat the cops, only if I had not been a human, but a squid that could reach the cops with arms over two feet long. Dear Mr. Richter, you should either refer to me as a squid or accept the falseness of this scenario, which was invented by the police. "</p>

<p>But despite the obvious fact that it is impossible for me to beat the policeman, the judge made a very clear statement: While he can not be sure that Mr. Dosthossein was the perpetrator, but because it is the statement of a police officer and we trust our police and the accused is already charged in two other cases with similar crimes, he is guilty and the court condemns him to imprisonment of 10 months and imprisonment for 100 days of forced labor. In two other cases, I was convicted only because the judge with similar behavior and statements did not accept the testimony of the witnesses I presented, but perceived the statements of police officers as something undeniable and sacred.</p>

<p>I objected to the judgment on 9 August 2018 and this process lasted until 3 June 2019. With the efforts of my lawyer, we managed to get the full movie of the demonstration. A professor, film and camera specialist, analyzed as a reviewer the whole scene and today at the third court hearing (the second session of the Court of Appeal), he could prove scientifically with detailed explanations and facts that I am not the so-called "perpetrator".</p>

<p>This was just my report from this process.</p>

But the most important thing is that I will announce:

<p>I realize that this case is a lawsuit against me by the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office and the Munich Police, which failed.</p>

<p>Second, the policeman knowingly and deliberately lied to me.</p>

<p>Third, the Judge of First Instance knowingly and purposely ignored the principle of impartiality of the judge with the support of the police and despite the fact that he was not sure whether I was the person who beat the policeman, my remarks were not accepted and sentenced me.</p>

<p>Fourth, the statements of the police officer in the first instance were deliberately not recorded by the judge in the present case. For that reason, during the appeal process, I was unable to use the contradictory statements of the police at the first court hearing against them.</p>

<p>Fifth: The judge of the Court of Appeal has overturned the first instance verdict and acquitted me only because a professor and film specialist has fully demonstrated that I am innocent. This happened while the judge deliberately refused to contact the police officer in front of the Geric</p>
