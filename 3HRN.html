    <h2> Hamed Rastkerdar Asylum Iranians fear for his life</h2>

       Fear of deportation: Hamed Rastkerdar (32) recently started working in the district of Heilbronn, but is still registered in Münsingen. He is a non-believer and politically active.

<p>
  He is fundamentally a quiet person, very polite and reserved. But when Hamed Rastkerdar speaks almost nothing, people listen with whom he is familiar. You know he's suffering from depression and was temporarily under psychiatric treatment.</p>

<p>His condition was particularly bad in July. He was nervous, barely able to sleep, always imagining that the police came by at night, ripped him out of bed and carried him to the next airport. "A deportation to Iran would mean my certain death."</p>

<p>But not the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees in Sigmaringen. Following a hearing that took place on 5 December 2016, a decision of the agency came to the conclusion that Hamed Rastkerdar would not face serious damage on his return to Iran. His political activities are "not relevant to persecution".</P>

<p>While there is growing evidence of targeted intimidation by opposition members abroad, "the Iranian authorities will only be interested in identifying by name a person whose activities go beyond the framework of mass-typical and low-profile manifestations of ex-political protests," it said. He would not have the prerequisites for subsidiary protection status. Therefore, the application for asylum was rejected.</p>

<p>Within 30 days</p>
Hamed Rastkerdar is requested to leave the Federal Republic within 30 days. The reasoning covers several pages. The Iranian prehistory, his political activities, his interrogation by the security department at the university, that he was forced to confirm in writing that he no longer questions the Qur'an, the sudden disappearance of a friend, is briefly discussed Sessions of the secret group has participated and the police search of the apartment of his parents. By this time he had already gone underground and had contacted the smugglers. Fearing that the friend, who has apparently been arrested, divulges his name under torture, he sees escape as the only way out of escaping arrest.</P>

<p>The decision maker in Sigmaringen does not believe him. The lecture seems "pale and insubstantial". The applicant was unable to convince that a hazardous situation existed. Even his now registered membership of the Central Council of ex-Muslims and the Workers' Communist Party could not lead to a more favorable outcome. At the same time, the letter acknowledges that the Iranian authorities are "intensively and comprehensively monitoring the political activities of their nationals abroad". All participants of events would be captured by informants within the group and filming. In addition, a so-called "Foreign Iranian Coordinating Council", a new section of the Iranian judiciary dedicated to "preserving national identity and defending the rights of foreigners", has begun work.</p>

<p>Monitoring of exile Iranians</p>

<p>This institution could be interpreted as an attempt to de facto extend Iranian criminal justice externally, in order to be able to punish exile political commitment directly from the Iranian judiciary and to bundle the surveillance of exile Iranians. However, it could be ruled out that in Germany "every Iranian is observed and identified".</P>

<p>Hamed Rastkerdar understood it this way: "The danger is great",He has appealed against the decision. The Secular Refugee Assistance, supported by the Central Council of ex-Muslims and the Giordano Bruno Foundation, is also addressing his case. And concludes, "If Hamed Rastkerdar were to be deported, his open admission to atheism would make him likely to be executed in Iran."</p>

<p>Apostasy means "apostasy". This word does not appear once in the rejection of the asylum application. Hamed Rastkerdar voices a suspicion. At his hearing in Sigmaringen, he had been given a Muslim translator who had not shared this message. Otherwise he can not explain why this essential point has not been included in the protocol at any point.</P>

<p>The "apostasy" is considered a serious crime in Iran. Male apostates face the death penalty. Renegade women must expect life imprisonment. The International Society for Human Rights cites Ayatollah Khomeini, who has formulated "difficult living conditions" for these women: "At the five daily prayer times, she must be flogged, and her quality of life and the amount of food, clothing and water must be reduced until she shows remorse. "The law has not changed significantly since.</p>



<p>Should it actually happen, his life would be over. "I will not even go to jail, they will kill me before." He is watching the protests in Iran with great concern. "Anyone who criticizes the government is taking a high risk."</p>



<p>Support by the Central Council of ex-Muslims</p>

<p>Hamed Rastkerdar is 32 years old. He comes from Rasht, the capital of the Iranian province Gilân. After his studies he worked as an interpreter. Because of his political activities, the security service becomes aware of him. When a comrade-in-law is arrested, he dives under. In August 2015 he flees via Turkey, the Mediterranean to Greece. He reached Germany via Bulgaria, Serbia and Austria. He is initially housed in a home for refugees in Mannheim, later comes to Engstingen and Bremelau. Since October 2016 Hamed Rastkerdar is registered in Münsingen. A transfer to the Heilbronn district, where he found a job a few days ago, is being prepared. He is a member of the Workers' Communist Party of Iran (API), which is banned in Iran, and belongs to the association "Central Council of ex-Muslims and other non-religious people" (ZdE) based in Cologne. He is also supported by this site. ZdE members stress in a letter that he faces the death penalty in his home country.
